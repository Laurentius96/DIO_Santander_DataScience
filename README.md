<summary><b>2. Exploring Generative AI in an ETL Pipeline with Python</b></summary>

### Description
Get ready for a practical journey through the world of Data Science! We'll build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, demonstrating the relationship between data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and APIs.

- **Extraction**: The adventure begins with a simple spreadsheet, from which we'll extract user IDs. Then, we'll use these IDs to access the 'Santander Dev Week 2023' API and obtain more detailed data.
- **Transformation**: We'll enter the universe of AI with OpenAI's GPT-4, transforming this data into personalized marketing messages.
- **Loading**: We'll finish the process by sending these messages back to the 'Santander Dev Week 2023' API.

### Objective
Reimagine the ETL process by applying the concepts learned in a new application domain.

<summary><b>3. Python Challenges: Balancing Balance</b></summary>

### Description
You've been hired by a banking company to assist with implementations and improvements to the business system. In an initial analysis, the finance team identified the need to develop a solution that allows customers to balance their bank accounts. The program should request an input representing the employee's current balance, and after that, the value of two transactions should be informed: a deposit and a withdrawal. The program should update the balance based on the transactions and display the final balance.

### Input
- `saldoAtual`: decimal number representing the current bank account balance.
- `valorDeposito`: decimal number representing the amount to be deposited into the account.
- `valorRetirada`: decimal number representing the amount to be withdrawn from the account.

### Output
A decimal number representing the updated balance in the bank account after processing the transactions.

<summary><b>4. Python Challenges: Organizing Your Assets</b></summary>

### Description
After a careful analysis conducted by the development team of a banking company, the need for a new functionality was identified to optimize processes and improve user experience. Your task is to implement a solution that organizes in alphabetical order a list of assets that will be informed by users. Assets are represented by strings that represent their types, such as: Liquidity reserves, Intangible assets, and others.

### Input
- An integer representing the number of assets the user has.
- Then, the user should provide, on separate lines, the types (strings) of the respective assets.

### Output
The list of Assets organized in alphabetical order, with each asset presented on a separate line.

<summary><b>5. Python Challenges: Conditionally Rich</b></summary>

### Description
A new feature for a banking system was analyzed by the development team and will be one of the tasks to be worked on during the sprint. As a company developer, you received the requirements for the new implementation, which consists of an algorithmic solution that allows customers to make withdrawals at ATMs.

### Withdrawal rules
- Each customer will enter the value of their `saldoTotal` from their bank account and the `valorSaque`.
- A withdrawal can only be made if the available balance in the account is equal to or greater than the requested amount.
- If the balance is sufficient, the requested amount should be subtracted from the available balance, indicating that the withdrawal was made.
- If the balance is insufficient, the withdrawal should not be made, and an appropriate message should be displayed.

### Input
Two integer values representing the total account balance and the withdrawal amount.

### Output
- If the withdrawal is successful: "Saque realizado com sucesso! Novo saldo: {saldo}"
- If the withdrawal is not possible: "Saldo insuficiente. Saque nao realizado!"

<summary><b>6. Python Challenges: Compound Interest</b></summary>

### Description
Imagine you're developing an application for a bank that wants to calculate the compound interest on an investment. Your goal is to create a function that takes three parameters: the initial investment value, the annual interest rate, and the time period in years. The function should calculate and return the final investment value after the specified period, taking into account compound interest.

### Input
- `valor_inicial`: integer or decimal number representing the initial investment value.
- `taxa_juros`: decimal number representing the annual interest rate (e.g., 5% = 0.05).
- `periodo`: integer representing the number of years of the investment.

### Output
The final investment value after the specified period, considering compound interest, rounded to two decimal places.

<summary><b>7. Python Challenges: The Big Deposit</b></summary>

### Description
You've been hired by a bank to develop a program that helps its customers make deposits into their accounts. The program should ask the customer for the deposit amount and check if the value is valid. If the value is greater than zero, the program should add the value to the account balance. Otherwise, the program should display an error message. The program should request the deposit amount only once.

### Input
The deposit amount entered by the customer (can be decimal, representing value in reais).

### Output
- If valid value (> 0): "Deposito realizado com sucesso! Saldo atual: R$ {valor}"
- If invalid value (< 0): "Valor invalido! Digite um valor maior que zero."
- If value is 0: "Encerrando o programa..."
